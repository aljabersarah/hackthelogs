# Hack The Logs

**Unlock the story of your logs.**

Welcome to **Hack The Logs**, a documentation platform and central hub for anyone looking to understand and manage log data across various systems and platforms.

This project is built to simplify logging — from deciding what to log, to understanding log formats, and ultimately improving detection and response capabilities.

Whether you're a SOC analyst, security engineer, or student, this resource offers:

- Clear explanations of log types and formats  
- Practical guidance on log baselining and forwarding  
- Recommendations aligned with **NIST SP 800-92** and the **Saudi National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA)** standards

## Coming Soon

A dedicated page on **log baselining** — what to send to SIEMs and how to configure it effectively — is in the works. Stay tuned!
